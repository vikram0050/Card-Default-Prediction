# Card-Default-Prediction
predicting whether a customer will default on his/her credit card
# Introduction

Default credit cards are an important issue that brings negative consequences to both sides, i.e, banks and customers. If a customer does not pay his obligations, banks lose money, the customer will lose credibility in future payments, collection calls start to be made and in last resort, the case may go into court. In order to avoid all of that trouble, effective methods that are able to predict the default of credit cards are needed. Therefore, default credit card prediction is an important, challenging, and useful task that should be addressed.

In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cashâ€“card debts. The crisis caused a blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders.

# Problem Statement

This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments
